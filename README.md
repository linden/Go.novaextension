# Go Language Definition for Nova

An ongoing attempt to build a Go language definition for the [Panic Nova](https://panic.com/nova) editor, using the Language Server Protocol (LSP) with Google's official `gopls` language server for Go.

**Note:** v0.4.3 is still an **alpha** version with working syntax highlighting and extra goodies from using the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/), but it is plagued with some unstability issues, often leading to a crash. See below for some guidelines.

[@jfieber](https://github.com/jfieber) added a 'Go' menu from which some functionality can be selected; in many cases, it will attempt to do a re-formatting according to Go's best practices, as well as organise imports. This is not working 100% of the time, though (and we still don't know why).

Worst case scenario: if _nothing_ here works for you, you might try to use Spicer Matthews' own [GoTools](nova://extension?id=cloudmanic.GoTools "This link will open only in Nova") extension. The syntax highlighting should be similar â€” and that extension should _not_ crash!

## Installation

Once activated, files ending in `*.go` should automatically be recognised (and formatted) as Go language files. Similarly, `*.tmpl` [Go template files](https://golang.google.cn/pkg/html/template/) will also be recognised<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>, and from version 0.4.0 onwards, even `go.mod` gets its own syntax highlighting.

Additional Go specific features are available by installing the [Go Language Server](https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/README.md), `gopls`. This will turn Nova into a quasi-IDE for Go!

If you use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install your packages, all you need is to type:

`brew install gopls`

If not, you can install it as described [here](https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/user.md#installation).

Then tick the _Enable Language Server_ checkbox in the Preferences for this extension. If `gopls` is (correctly) installed in your search `PATH`, the extension should find it. If it is elsewhere, set that where in the Preferences for this extension as well. Note that Nova's language server support and `gopls` are both new and evolving. Many things may _not_ work quite right yet.

When checking for syntax errors, `gopls` can optionally use https://staticcheck.io/ for additionally analysis; there is a checkbox on Preferences to allow the extra checking.

**WARNING:** (aye, again) If you click on _Format/Organise Imports when saving file_ to get `gopls` to automatically reformat your code when saving, be warned: it _really_ does corrupt the files! I'm _not_ joking. The option is there just because I'm hoping to try it out until I find a way to fix the issue.

More information on the capabilities of `gopls` as well as its design/implementation considerations can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/design/design.md). As Nova gets better and better integration with Language Servers, and as Google also improves `gopls` to be more compliant with Microsoft's LSP definition, a lot of functionality will appear 'automagically' by simply upgrading Nova or `gopls`.

## Disclaimers

I'm _still_ a bit clueless about how the syntax highlighting engine/parser actually parses the language files (although some things are starting to make more sense). There is _very little_ 'official' documentation; however, on the site for an editor made by a competitor, it looks like they have used something very similar, and â€” allegedly! â€” based on the original Coda syntax (not Coda 2!). Apparently, Nova uses a variant of the same parser 'family'.

This version includes a `Go.xml` Syntax template which was cobbled together out of a _lot_ of sources, namely, the Coda 2 Go language definition files; the Nova (included) language files for PHP, TypeScript (because Go is also strongly typed), JavaScript, and even C++; I've made extensive use of https://regex101.com/ to check the correctness of most (if not all) regular expressions needed for the syntax highlighting; and I'm also very quite thankful for the (incomplete) work made by [@ambelovsky](https://github.com/ambelovsky/espresso-golang) (on GitHub), when adapting the old Coda syntax for the editor from the competition. Several of his comments have been copied and incorporated. His work was sadly not completed, still had a lot of errors (basically he used the template for JavaScript), and, at the date of writing, was abandoned nine years ago. Nevertheless, it had lots of very interesting structures to parse the Go language (while leaving several others unimplemented). While strongly _inspired_ by his work, this is not merely a copy & paste â€” many adaptations were required to get some of the functionality to actually work. A lot still doesn't (it gets silently ignored) and I still haven't figured out how to deal with them...

Additionally, I've included a Syntax template for Go Templates. It's almost exactly the same as the syntax for Smarty templates (which I have been using) with some tiny changes, which I hope to have correctly implemented.

The new, incuded syntax highlighter for `go.mod` files was mostly an experiment. It works quite well, though, since the language definition for that is so simple.

Although the current version includes a Completions file, I don't see any kind of completion happening (except for closing braces). I've tried to figure out how the syntax of the Completions file works, but it's even more obscure (to me) than the actual Syntax file. The two are also possibly related â€” through common identifiers â€” but I fail to understand exactly how the two 'play' together. I've gotten access to a few more resources explaining this format, so maybe I'll give it another try.

Also, Nova â€” unlike Coda â€” allows extensions to use the [Language Server Protocol](https://langserver.org/) (like their closest competitors do), a Microsoft-promoted effort enabling a '_write once, reuse often_' philosophy for writers of syntax checkers. In other words, the hard work is put into creating a _functioning_ LSP 'server' (basically an application that reads a file in a specific language, or parts of a file, and figures out if it has any syntax errors) by the community of syntax checkers. _Then_ editor plugins (of all kinds, not only desktop apps) can interface with such a server in order to get syntax checking. In theory, it's a very easy way to quickly expand the ability for a code editor to accept gazillions of languages without requiring the developers to spend days and nights coding as many syntax checkers as possible. With new languages coming up all the time, many becoming fashionable for a few years and disappearing shortly afterwards, this method ensures that editor developers are not wasting their precious time. It also means that updating syntax checkers for upcoming new versions of a specific language will not require any coding â€” just upgrade the LSP server. And, finally, it also means that _all_ code editors will check syntax in the _same, predictable_ way (and also that _all_ will get upgraded to the latest version of the syntax almost immediately), which means that, if you switch editors, the 'new' editor will _already_ support the latest version of your favourite programming language _and_ syntax checking will work in pretty much the same way...

Therefore, this extension can optionally use the official (Google-supported) [Go Language Server](https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/README.md) if you install it as described in the Installation section above. Thanks to recent improvements in Nova, it's now almost fully functional. Enjoy ðŸ˜Œ

The LSP specification is still very quirky. Microsoft developed the LSP specifically for Visual Studio Code, their free, open-source, cross-platform editor, thus allowing non-Microsoft-specific languages to be as easily integrated with their editor. However, the Microsoft specifications are _very_ Microsoft-centric, and the Google team behind `gopls` grumbles and complains about several ambiguous descriptions in the protocol, and the choices they've made to implement the (complex) specifications. Sadly, though, those specifications are _very_ Google-centric (notice the pattern?) and they don't match easily with the Microsoft ones. And on top of all that, we have to deal with Panic's own implementation of LSP support â€” which is (at the time of writing!) a bit obscure, a bit opaque, and not exactly super-well-documented (namely, at least for me, it's not obvious what Nova does on its own and what the extension developer has to do). We have to take hints from the very few others who travelled the same road and try to figure out how they've done it.

Note that Nova logs many interactions with the language server in the Extension Console, and if you run this extension in "developer mode" (see the _Extension Development_ item in Nova's _General_ preferences) `gopls` will write logs to `/tmp/gopls.log` but these can be quite a bit cryptic.

In conclusion: all of the above is still very much a _work in progress_ â€” or rather, a _lot_ of work in progress. There is far less functionality which actually does anything than lots of files with rules that are _supposed_ to do _something_ but... don't. Therefore, _caveat utilitor_.

Suggestions and bug reports are more than welcome, but please take into account that I'm new to all of this, and might not be able to even _understand_ most of your issues, much less _fix_ them! But I'm learning...

## Well-known bugs

### Syntax Checker bugs

1. On function definitions, the return values are not properly formatted (not even recognised by Nova)
2. Similarly, the `return` keyword will confuse the formatting of the ensuing expressions
3. On function definitions, arguments such as `(a,b integer)` _will_ be correctly formatted, but they are on the completely wrong scope (compare it with writing `(a integer, b integer)` instead)
4. Type declaration is still a work-in-progress; it's now foldable, but doesn't work correctly (getting it right is tough!)
5. Even variable declaration is... sketchy, at best. Some instances of it work; most don't
6. No type casting done (yet)
7. `make` and `append` aren't done yet

### Go Language Server bugs

1. Right now, the one issue that baffles me most is why the imports formatter does not work properly (i.e. the equivalent functionality to `goimports` which is allegedly built-in into the `gopls` Language Server)! It still has a very serious bug when figuring out what exactly to delete and shuffle around. Don't try it out without saving your files properly!
2. As said before, do **NOT** turn on the automatic formatting when saving! Until this issue isn't fixed, that option is essentially there only for the purpose of allowing others to do some testing. It's _not_ meant for anything else!
3. The `Go` menu (either from the top bar or by right-clicking on the text) runs the formatter most of the time, without crashing. Sometimes it does nothing; sometimes you have to select the whole range you wish to format in order to get it working. This is still a bit unpredictable, although I can't understand why it doesn't work _some_ times, while in _most_ cases, it has no issue whatsoever (even on the same, unchanged code!).
4. If you're plagued with extension crashes, just \_un*check the \_Enable Language Server* checkbox on the Preferences for this extension. You will still get Go syntax highlighting (and some auto-completion), but the additional goodies provided by LSP will be turned off.
5. There are a few hooks allowing you to _theoretically_ run some post-formatting tools to comply with Google's style guidelines for Go, as well as a way to check that all imports are properly referenced, etc. With this version, there is no documentation yet for _how_ to activate those extra features, but hopefully this will be addressed in the future... eventually.
